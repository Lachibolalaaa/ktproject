"I wanna be the very best like no one ever was. To catch them is my real test, to train them is my cause." Pokémon is a series all about the grind and that means that there will be a lot of training involved. Training is, of course, the only way that Ash will ever become good enough to be the very best.


Pokémon teaches fans that the only way that you can truly be the best is to train your heart out. Nothing is given up easy so the only way to reach the final goal is to keep practicing no matter what.</div>
